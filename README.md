# A small program to allow you to type Esperanto characters.

Typing "cx" will change into ĉ, and the same for ĝ, ŝ, ĵ, ĥ, and ŭ (and their capital counterparts)

A tray icon (found in the bottom right of your monitor) allows you to toggle on and off the program.

If you want to change it to "ch", simply edit the .ahk (source) file.
Change the line `::cx::ĉ` to `::ch::ĉ`, and the same with hx, etc.
You will then need to recompile or run the .ahk file.
